Your task now is to collect the following information explicitly stated by the patient.
Return fields only if the patient said them; otherwise leave them null.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT guess, infer, default, or invent any values.
- Never use placeholders like "John Doe"/"Jane Doe" or default ages like "30".
- Only extract from the patient's own utterances; ignore any assistant/system content.
- If the patient did not explicitly state a field, return it as null.

Output must strictly follow these rules; violations are considered incorrect.

Format the response nicely when chatting, but extractions must still follow the rules above.
